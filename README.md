### üìÆ Updating Postal Codes

If you need to update or add postal codes, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Locate the Data File
The postal code data is stored in the `src/utils/postal-code.ts` file. The data is organized by districts with each district containing an array of postal entries.

#### Step 2: Understand the Data Structure
The postal data follows this structure in the `postalData` object:

```typescript
export const postalData: DistrictData = {
  "DistrictName": [
    {
      city: "City Name",
      sub: "Sub-area Name",
      postalCode: "1234"
    },
    {
      city: "Another City",
      sub: "Another Sub-area",
      postalCode: "1235"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry contains:
- `city`: The city name
- `sub`: The sub-area or specific location name
- `postalCode`: The 4-digit postal code

#### Step 3: Add or Update Postal Codes

**To add a new postal entry to an existing district:**
- Find the district in the `postalData` object
- Add a new entry to the district's array:

```typescript
"Existing District": [
  // ... existing entries
  {
    city: "New City",
    sub: "New Sub-area",
    postalCode: "1234"
  }
]
```

**To update an existing postal code:**
- Find the specific entry in the district array
- Update the `city`, `sub`, or `postalCode` values as needed

#### Step 4: Validate Your Changes
After updating the data:

1. **Test the API locally:**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Test your new postal codes:**
   ```bash
   # Test district search
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/district/your-district-name

   # Test city search
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/city/your-city-name

   # Test postal code search
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/code/your-postal-code
   ```

3. **Verify search functionality:**
   - Test partial matching for district/city names
   - Test exact matching for postal codes
   - Test multi-parameter searches

#### Step 5: Submit Your Changes

1. **Create a descriptive commit message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add postal codes for [District/City/Area]"
   ```

2. **Include in your PR description:**
   - What postal codes you added/updated
   - Which districts/cities were affected
   - Any special considerations or notes

#### Step 6: Quality Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] All new postal codes are valid and accurate
- [ ] Data structure follows the established format (flat array under each district)
- [ ] API endpoints return correct results for your changes
- [ ] No duplicate entries exist within the same district
- [ ] District, city, and sub-area names are properly formatted
- [ ] Postal codes are in the correct format (4 digits for Bangladesh)
- [ ] Each entry has all three required fields: `city`, `sub`, and `postalCode`
- [ ] The `postalData` object structure is maintained

#### Common Issues to Avoid

- **Duplicate entries**: Check existing data within the same district before adding
- **Incorrect formatting**: Follow the exact TypeScript structure with `city`, `sub`, and `postalCode` fields
- **Invalid postal codes**: Ensure codes are 4 digits and valid for Bangladesh
- **Missing data**: Ensure all three required fields (`city`, `sub`, `postalCode`) are present
- **Wrong data structure**: Don't use nested objects - use flat arrays under each district
- **Inconsistent naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for districts, cities, and sub-areas

#### Need Help?

If you're unsure about the data structure or need help with your contribution:

1. Check existing data entries for reference
2. Open an issue describing what you want to add/update
3. Ask questions in the issue or PR comments
